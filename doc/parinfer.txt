*parinfer.txt*	Automagic Lisp Bracket Balancing

==============================================================================
I. INTRODUCTION		    *parinfer* *parinfer-lua* *parinfer-introduction*

This plugin does smart things to maintain balanced parentheses as you type in
lisp code.

Unlike most lisp-editing plugins, this plugin does not add new mappings for
structural editing. Instead, it has modes to infer brackets from indentation,
to infer indentation from brackets, and a smart mode that looks at the change
you are making to determine which method to use.

It is based on a Lua port of Shaun Lebron's "parinfer" library. This manual
covers the Neovim plugin part only - you should visit the parinfer website for
information on what parinfer itself does for you.

This plugin can be used with |vim-sexp|, although you will probably want to
set |g:sexp_enable_insert_mode_mappings| to 0. Otherwise, you will not be able
to type brackets.

II. COMMANDS 						   *parinfer-commands*

                                                                *:ParinferLog*
With an argument, starts logging each handled event to the named file.
Without an argument, stops logging. This is useful for debugging Vim event
handling and submitting bug reports.

								*:ParinferOff*
Disables parinfer processing. This is useful when a file is too large to be
processed quickly or when a file contains badly balanced parentheses that you
want to preserve.

								 *:ParinferOn*
Enables parinfer processing. Parinfer starts enabled.

==============================================================================
III. OPTIONS				       		    *parinfer-options*

							     *g:parinfer_mode*
The mode used to process buffer changes: 'smart', 'indent', or 'paren'.
>
        " Default
        let g:parinfer_mode = 'smart'
<
						    *g:parinfer_force_balance*
In smart mode and indent mode, parinfer will sometimes leave unbalanced
brackets around the cursor and fix them when the cursor moves away.  When this
option is set to 1 or |v:true|, the brackets will be fixed immediately (and
fixed again when text is inserted).
>
        " Default
	let g:parinfer_force_balance = 0
